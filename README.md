## Funtime Golf

A simple minigolf game written in pygame. Levels can be created by defining the ball, holes and walls in round_data.py - see schema and example round for guidance.

This config will feed into the Game object, being used to create rounds, with the game then running each of the rounds in turn

Eventually will look to add a main menu, with the ability to choose between levels.
